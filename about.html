<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>
    I am a Swedish student studying IT, focusing on hardware like servers and networking, and software like arduino and web development. 
    I am currently in my third year in gymnasiet,<sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup> and am planning on going to an yrkeshögskola<sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup>
    hoping to study DevOps for two years.
</p>

<h2>What do I do?</h2>
<p>
    As mentioned I am currently studying full time. On my free time I like to code (see my projects <a href="/projects.html">here</a>),
    learning new things, playing video games if I have the time, and photography (see the <a href="/gallery.html">gallery</a>
    and my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hardomx/">Instagram</a>).
</p>
<p>
    Currently (until May 2024), I am the CEO of a company made through UF.<sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup>
    Together with some friends, we are currently developing and are going to sell a passive audio mixer that lets
    you combine different sources to one pair of headphones. Find us at <a href="https://www.hardbergsljud.se">hardbergsljud.se</a>.
